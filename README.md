# netMon
a Distributed Network Monitoring Solution using the leaf-spine model. Leaf nodes running on low-cost hardware (rasberry pi's only at the moment) that are able to launch various network probes to give an overview of the health of the network. Spine nodes are running in the main datacentres having the same probes as leafs but also run network services used by the leafs like iperf.
